## **Abstract**

Should policymakers increase direct insurance to workers during recessions as in the US, or seek to provide insurance to existing employment relationships by subsidising the continuation of matches as in Continental Europe? This paper seeks to shed light on this question through the lens of a variant of the standard Mortensen & Pissarides (1994) matching model with endogenous job destruction, where workers are risk-averse, face uninsurable income risk in the labour market, and make an endogenous search decision when unemployed. In this standard environment, social welfare depends not only on the average level of worker income but all higher-order moments of the worker income distri- bution, and in particular the degree of income that workers face. Moreover, changes in UI and employment subsidies have opposite effects on the degree of income risk workers face - UI always increases income risk via its effect on job creation and destruction, whereas employment subsidies act in the opposite direction. We use a calibrated version of the model to quantify the importance of the different effects of UI and match subsidies on worker income risk for so- cial welfare during a recession. Overall we find that whilst both policies deliver welfare gains, match subsidies roughly double the welfare gains compared to the increase in UI, suggesting that the impact of policies on worker income risk is indeed quantitatively significant for normative analysis using this standard framework.
